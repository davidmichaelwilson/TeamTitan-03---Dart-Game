Instructions
Now it's time for you to build out this game. The objective is to hit 100 points.

The game should work like this:

The game starts at 0, 0 for the score.

Player One goes first.

Clicking the "Throw Darts" button shows a random number in the score graphic of 1 - 20.

That number adds to the Score.

Player Two goes next.

Steps 3 and 4 happen.

After this the players alternate.The score should keep incrementing.

Whoever reaches 100 points wins. Show a message saying which player wins.

Reset the game to 0,0.

Improvements:
Once you've done the basics, improve the game by:

Fixing the probabilities of hitting different numbers on the dart board.

Do something special when a player gets a 20 or bullseye.

Make the UI pretty.
